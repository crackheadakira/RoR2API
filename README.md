This all originated from when I wanted to try learning Vue, so I decided on a site that shows you all the items Risk of Rain 2 has. But I ran into a problem, there was no simple online database with all the info I needed.
I then saw this as a chance to learn making a REST api, so I began with that, but after writing the app file I realized it would be too tedious to manually have to create each entry for the item. That's when a friend of mine, [Fülöp Tibor](https://github.com/TibixDev), recommended I take this as a chance to learn JSDom too, and that's exactly what I did. After watching alot of YouTube tutorials for getting the grasp on REST APIs, I dove my head in. 

The very first code I wrote for the project was quite finicky, as it barely functioned properly. After messing around with the code for sometime I got the JSON files to properly show up with all the correct directories, and once I had done that it was time for me to expand the database.

*( All the info I used for the JSON files came from the [Risk of Rain 2 Wiki](https://riskofrain2.fandom.com/wiki/Risk_of_Rain_2_Wiki) )*

I found it a big pain in the ass to scrape this fandom wiki, as there was no "easy" identifiers I could use to get all the necessary information without writing some very hard-to-read code.

Here are some images taken during the progress, they may or may not feature code or just results:
